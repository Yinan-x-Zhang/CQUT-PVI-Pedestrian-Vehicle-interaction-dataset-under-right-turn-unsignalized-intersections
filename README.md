**This is a dataset of pedestrian-vehicle interaction under a right-turn unsignalized intersection**

We selected two traffic scenes with different road conditions for video acquisition. Scene one is the unsignalized right-turn intersection at the intersection of Hongguang Avenue and Hongli Avenue in Banan District, Chongqing, and scene two is the unsignalized right-turn intersection at Longzhou Avenue in Huaxi Street, Banan District, Chongqing


Both intersections were shot in the air by DJ-MINI2 UAV, with a flight height of 25 meters and a maximum flight time of 30 minutes, effective pixels of 12 million, CMOS image sensor, video resolution of 3480Ã—2160, frame rate of 30fps, scene 1 is a two-way four-lane right-turn intersection, and scene 2 is a two-way two-lane right-turn intersection.

The video data was divided into commuting and non-commuting hours, and the weather included sunny and cloudy days. Commuting hours were from 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and non-commuting hours were from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Three hours per day were collected, for a total of 180 hours. Human-vehicle interactions under peak and lull periods were collected separately. From the large amount of video data, a total of 1000 pedestrians with clear game states were extracted from each scene, for a total of 2000 human-vehicle interaction events and a total of 340,710 data frames.

A total of 4 data sets are included, CP1,CP2,NCP1,NCP2. The format of our collected dataset is interaction event number, pedestrian lateral coordinates, pedestrian longitudinal coordinates, pedestrian speed, pedestrian acceleration, pedestrian waiting time, vehicle lateral coordinates, vehicle longitudinal coordinates, vehicle speed, vehicle acceleration, vehicle waiting time,pedestrian-vehicle relative distance, and post-encroachment time, respectively.
